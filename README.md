# Simple-Portable-PS4

## Introduction
This mod only works with CUH-21xx PS4 (slim)
It can work with CUH-20xx (slim) but with some modifications, never tested with CUH-22xx BUT it should work.

It will not work with PS4 fat or PS4 Pro.

You can buy everything on amazon except the display and hinges because i had thoose at home and they are from an acer aspire one D257.
Check out the parts list for more details.

## The story
I have always been attracted to the Souls games. I played Dark Souls 1, 2, 3, Bloodborne, and finally Elden Ring. 
I spent more than 200 hours on Elden Ring and started to feel the frustration of being able to play it only at home on my PS5. 
So, I began looking at all the portable consoles available on the market. 
I saw GPD, Rog Ally, MSI Claw, Legion GO, and so on.
The only problem has always been the price, and my partner never allowed me to spend 700 euros on a portable console.

So, I decided to recycle some materials I had at home to create my console. 
I had an old PS4 Slim and an Acer Aspire One D257 lying around unused. 
I disassembled the PS4 motherboard, studied the power supply's wiring diagram, and ordered an LVDS board for the netbook display. 
I took the batteries from an old hoverboard and built a 150Wh battery pack. 
I laid out all the components on my desk and sketched a design on paper for how I could assemble the components together. 
I downloaded Fusion360 and got to work immediately. 
The first draft didn’t go well because I had never designed in 3D before, my 3D printer wasn’t big enough, and the pieces didn’t fit together.
So, I kept trying and retrying until I learned how to design in 3D, and that’s when the PS4 Portable started to take shape. For the design, I was inspired by the iPhone 4: flat but with rounded corners.

The other big challenge was the power supply: managing to create a power supply strong enough to play games (12V, 10A) but adjustable to charge the console without damaging the batteries (12.6V, 0.5A). 
In the end, I decided to "merge" two different power supplies and use a switch to select between charging mode or gameplay mode.
This limitation is due to the extremely compact size of the console: if I had made it larger, I could have included a MOSFET that opened the gate with 3.3V feedback from the motherboard, allowing me to know when the console was on or off. 
This way, I could have switched the power modes automatically, but all this will come in version 2.0 of the portable PS4 when I will also include support for an external CD reader.

## The goal
Now I can play my Souls games anywhere.
